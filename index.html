             It's almost like we need a strong dose of something to knock out of all the misinformation. But despite all the myths
            and urban legends, about half of the U.S population is fully vaccinated.

            Well, not to some. Vaccinated people are up against a new set of myths &horbar; they're litteraly magnetic or they're
            going to shed vaccine components and alter the DNA of unvaccinated people. And despite the extra layer of protection,
            ther still have to grapple with the same pandemic realities as everyone else.

            So, what do vaccinated people need to stay safe? And is it still possible for them to spread COVID-19 to others?
            Infectious disease specialist 
            <a href="google.com/LysetteCardona"
            style="color:rgba(250, 179, 14, 0.916); text-decoration-color: blue;">Lysette Cardona</a>, MD, answers those questions and covers why vaccination is still one of our best weapons in
            fight against COVID-19.
<br>
<br>
            Isn't the time to let your guard down. While the vaccines are potent, there's still a chance that you could become infected.
