    <h3>Travelling in Depression</h3>
    <p>When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought
        me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has
        given me a unique learning experience.
    </p>
    <p> At five, I 
        <a href="http://www.google.com/marvel">
            marveled
        </a>
        at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the
        heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways
        on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and

        walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the
        thousand-year-old stones were still in place just as it is in

    It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first
    became interested in language.

        It began with French, which taught me the importance of
         pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris
         where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it
        PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on
        the A, she looked at me bewildered.

        In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and
        aware of its similarities with English through cognates.
        Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks
        different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to
        me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates
        come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.

        Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I 
        studied Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was
         missing from a character, the meaning is lost.
          I loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, 
        so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be 
        joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. I love 
        spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel
         the beauty and rhythm as I form them.
